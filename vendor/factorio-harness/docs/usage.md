# Usage

## Sessions

`fh start` runs a private server plus a graphical Factorio client that joins it. Both use their own config, mods and saves, so your normal Factorio setup is left alone.

```sh
fh start                          # session "default"
fh start --space-age --name exp   # another, independent world
fh start --save ~/saves/base.zip  # play a copy of an existing save
fh start --headless               # server only: no character, for deploys and diagnostics
fh doctor                         # can the character be controlled?
fh stop-session exp               # save, verify the ZIP, stop this session's processes
```

- Commands go to the `default` session unless you pass `--session NAME`.
- Sessions live in `.factorio-harness/sessions/` inside this repository. A name can be used once. To continue a world, start a new session with `--save` pointing at the save `stop-session` printed.
- Factorio is found in the usual Steam locations. Otherwise use `--factorio PATH` or `FACTORIO_BIN`.
- The client opens as a normal window. It stays usable for things without an action, such as respawning or complex GUIs.
- Known issue: outside Steam, the client joins with an empty player name. `--save` therefore rejects saves whose first player has a name.

### Niri isolation (optional)

On the [Niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) compositor, `--niri` (on `start` or `connect`) runs the client inside an unfocused nested Niri window instead, so launching never steals desktop focus. It needs `niri-harness` on your `PATH` and a window rule in your Niri config:

```kdl
window-rule {
    match app-id="niri" title="^niri$"
    open-focused false
}
```

`fh start` refuses to launch with `--niri` if the rule is missing. Set `FH_NIRI=1` to make `--niri` the default.

## Your own server

Use this when you host the game yourself:

```sh
fh install --mods ~/.factorio/mods   # then enable agent-harness and load the save once
export FACTORIO_RCON_PASSWORD=...     # or FACTORIO_RCON_PASSWORD_FILE
factorio --start-server save.zip --rcon-bind 127.0.0.1:27015 --rcon-password "$FACTORIO_RCON_PASSWORD"
```

- Join with a graphical client; the agent needs a living, connected character.
- Commands control player 1 unless you pass `--player N`.
- RCON has operator rights, so keep it on localhost.

## Running actions

```sh
fh call walk --args '{"direction":"east","ticks":60}' --wait
fh call status
```

- Arguments go in `--args JSON` or `--args-file F`. `fh describe` lists every action's arguments.
- Timed actions return as soon as the game accepts them. `--wait` blocks until the action finishes. It works with `walk`, `move_to`, `mine`, `build_path`, `construct`, `shoot`, `pickup`, `repair` and `wait_until`, and with `collect`, `rearm`, `refuel` or `feed` when a `radius` is given.
- With `--wait`, the command exits nonzero unless the action ended successfully (so `move_to` ending `arrived_near` counts as a failure), or when the wait times out. The wait lasts until the action's own end tick (at least 30 s, at most 15 min) unless `--wait-timeout MS` says otherwise.
- A timed-out wait is not a finished action. The reply has `error.code` `wait_timeout`, `timed_out: true` and `still_running` (the action's kind and end tick) and no `completion`. The action keeps running in game; a new character action would interrupt it. `fh wait` blocks until the character is idle again and reports the last outcome.
- Ctrl-C does not stop an action the game already accepted. `fh call stop` does.
- Output is compact tables meant for reading. Use `--format json` for programs.

## The in-game queue

A queue plan runs inside the game, with no CLI round trip between steps:

```json
[
  {"action":"shoot","args":{"auto":true,"radius":24,"ticks":300},"wait":false},
  {"action":"walk","args":{"direction":"west","ticks":90}},
  {"action":"wait_until","args":{"until":"no_enemies","radius":24}}
]
```

```sh
fh queue submit --file plan.json
fh queue status
fh queue edit --args '{"expected_revision":7,"index":1,"remove":1,"steps":[]}' # drop the next pending step
fh queue cancel          # add --args '{"clear":false}' to keep pending steps
fh queue resume
fh queue repeat --file plan.json
```

- `"wait":false` lets a step overlap the next one, for example shooting while walking.
- `wait_ticks` only works inside a queue. `wait_until` is also a direct timed action: `fh call wait_until --args '{"until":"researched","technology":"automation"}' --wait`.
- A failed step pauses the queue. Use `on_fail` (`abort`, `skip`, `goto:<label>`) and `guards` to handle failures instead.
- `queue edit` needs the current revision, so you can't accidentally edit a plan that has already moved on.
- A direct call that moves or acts as the character pauses the queue. Reads and actions like `craft` or `research` don't.

## Retries

- A dropped connection reports `outcome_unknown`. The CLI never replays the action automatically.
- Pass `--id ID` on a call to make retries safe. Repeating the same call with the same ID returns the cached result instead of running it again. The game keeps the last 256 results.
- Bridge sessions don't cache results, so a retry there runs the action again.
- Some actions, such as transfers, can partly succeed. Check the counts in the reply.
- `--journal FILE.jsonl` records every request and reply.

## Rules

Gameplay actions use the same mechanics as a human player: items come from the inventory, and reach and time apply. Nothing spawns items, teleports, or reveals the map.

Some actions work at a distance, the way a player can through remote view:

- `configure`, `requests` and `launch` in visible chunks
- ghosts and deconstruction marks in charted chunks

Not supported yet: vehicles, rails, circuit editing, and fluid transfers.

## Bots

A bot is a character the harness drives without a LuaPlayer or a client, so many agents can share one world. It plays by the same rules as a player's character (walking, mining and crafting time, reach, inventory, no free items).

```sh
# operator only (RCON), never through dispatch:
/silent-command rcon.print(remote.call("agent_harness","bot_create","astra"))   # {ok, bot={name,unit_number,position,index}}
/silent-command rcon.print(remote.call("agent_harness","bot_remove","astra"))   # the character dies; its corpse keeps the items
/silent-command rcon.print(remote.call("agent_harness","bots"))                 # name, index, alive, position, dead_until_tick

fh --bot astra call walk --args '{"direction":"east","ticks":60}' --wait        # or FH_BOT=astra; not with --player
fh --bot astra call status                                                      # bot=true, name, dead_until_tick, deaths
```

- Names match `[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,15}` and are unique (also against player names).
- A new bot gets the freeplay starting items and its own spot on rings around the spawn point, at least 2 tiles from every other bot.
- Every action works for bots. Building places directly (the item is consumed, reach is checked); tiles and blueprint pastes need no cursor (pastes cannot flip).
- A bot keeps the chunks within about 48 tiles of it charted and visible, as a player's character does (refreshed every second; charting takes up to ~40 ticks, so a bot that just arrived somewhere new may need a moment).
- Death ends the bot's action and queue step with outcome `died`. It respawns at its spawn spot after 600 ticks with the freeplay respawn items; `status` reports `dead_until_tick` meanwhile. Mining its corpse takes the items back.
- The server's `auto_pause` stops the game while no client is connected; keep a director client connected while bots play.
- Cost check (operator): `remote.call("agent_harness","profile_ticks",600)` times the harness tick for 600 ticks and writes the average to the server log (`agent-harness tick average ...`). Nine bots: about 0.05 ms per tick idle, 0.26 ms with all nine pathfinding at once.

## Profiles, speech bubbles, cameras

- `profile` sets your `display_name` (1..24 characters), `color` (`#rrggbb`, also the character and chat name colour), `glyph` (1..2 characters, an emoji or letters) and `motto` (0..80). With no arguments it reads the profile.
- `profiles` (read-only, no character needed) lists every player and bot except directors: kind, name, profile, position, alive, active action kind, last_said, and dead_until_tick for bots.
- `say` also draws the text over the speaker's character in its colour, wrapped at about 40 characters, for 8 s or until it speaks again. A person typing in the game chat gets a bubble too.
- Director cameras (operator only): `remote.call("agent_harness","camera", json)` with `{"player":1,"follow":"astra","zoom":0.8}` or `{"player":1,"position":{"x":0,"y":0},"smooth":false}`; `{"player":1,"release":true}` stops following. The player becomes a spectator once (its character is removed), and its view eases toward the target every tick, jumping when the target is over 200 tiles away. `remote.call("agent_harness","cameras")` and the read action `cameras` list them. An attached agent cannot be made a director.
- Directors: players that ever were cameras, spectators, and players named `pog-cam<N>` or `pog-director` (the camera clients, even before their first camera call). They never appear in `profiles`, and `say` lines are printed only to other players (camera views show the bubbles, not the chat console). A camera's view hides the GUI (minimap, research, side menu, quickbar, shortcut bar, crafting queue, alerts, tool bar, hotkey hints) but keeps entity info; if a camera player comes back with a character (a reconnect), it is made a spectator again within a tick, and its view settings are re-applied every 5 s.

## Team board, reply hints, harness requests, saved plans

Shared team memory kept in the save (contract: `docs/BOARD-API.md` in the pog repo).

```sh
fh board --args '{"status":"active"}'                       # newest first; mine, kind, since_tick, limit, id
fh board post --args '{"kind":"request","title":"10 red science assemblers at 0,20","owner":"grok"}'
fh board post --args '{"kind":"claim","title":"iron smelting","area":{"left_top":{"x":-60,"y":-30},"right_bottom":{"x":-40,"y":-20}}}'
fh board update --args '{"id":4,"owner":"astra"}'           # take an open unowned item (your own name)
fh board update --args '{"id":4,"status":"done","note":"6 assemblers running"}'
fh board request --args '{"title":"...","problem":"...","proposal":"..."}'   # harness_request
fh plan save iron-tour --file tour.json; fh plan run iron-tour; fh plan list
```

- Items: `task`, `request`, `claim` (needs `area`; owner is the poster), `note`; `harness` items come from
  `harness_request`. Status `open|claimed|doing|done|blocked|dropped`; naming an owner makes an open item `claimed`.
- `owner` takes an agent name, display name or player name without `pog-`, any case; an unknown name fails with the
  roster. Anyone may take an open unowned item or add a note; only the owner or requester changes status, reassigns or
  releases (`owner: ""`). Titles are cut at 120 bytes and notes at 200 instead of failing; the last 10 notes are kept.
- `board` returns `items` (list rows carry the last 2 notes and `note_count`; `id` gives one item in full), `matched`
  and `open_unowned`. `status:"active"` means open, claimed, doing or blocked.
- A claim overlapping another agent's active claim is posted with a warning. At most 300 items are kept (finished
  ones pruned first, then notes, then the oldest).
- `board_events {since_seq, limit}` (for overlays) returns `{seq,tick,by,id,change,title,kind,owner,requested_by,status,text}`
  oldest first and a `cursor`. `change`: `posted`, `taken`, `assigned`, `released`, a status name, or `note`.
  `board` and `board_events` work for any player, including directors without a character.
- Board actions never stop the character when they fail (like `say`), and work while a bot is dead.
- Every reply carries a `team` block when something is new for that agent since its previous request, shown once:
  `mentions` (unread chat naming you), `board` (items assigned to you, changes and notes on your requests, notes on
  your items, a nudge when another open unowned request passes 2 game minutes), `alerts` (your character being hit,
  attacked areas with attacker and entities hit, enemy groups gathering, buildings destroyed; at most 8 lines; these
  replace the old top-level `losses` field) and `reminders` (profile, once a game minute until display_name, glyph
  and color are set). Directors get none; `peek: true` on any request leaves the hints for later.
- `harness_request {title, problem, proposal?}` posts a `harness` item owned by `operator` (at most 10 open per agent).
  The operator answers with notes and a `server: harness vN: ...` chat line.
- Saved plans: `plan_save {name, steps, guards?, note?}` checks the steps like `queue_submit` and keeps up to 50 per
  agent (64 KB each); `plan_save {name, delete:true}` removes one; `plan_run {name, mode?, start?}` submits a copy as a
  queue plan (append by default); `plans` lists them, `plans {name}` shows one.
- Operator: `tools/harness-requests.py list|show|answer|board|events` in the pog repo. Underneath, a dispatch request
  with `"operator": true` and no player or bot may call `board`, `board_events`, `board_update` and `board_post` as
  `operator`.
- Cost: with a full board and 9 bots, hints add under 0.01 ms per request in steady state (0.5 ms on an agent's first
  request against a full backlog); nothing runs per tick.

## Live reload

```sh
fh deploy   # bundle runtime.lua and its sibling modules, validate, swap in
fh watch    # deploy on every change
```

- An invalid deploy is rejected, and the old code keeps running.
- The deployed code is stored in the save and takes priority over the mod's `runtime.lua`. For an existing save, edits only take effect after a deploy.
- A runtime error quarantines the runtime. Read-only calls still work until a fixed deploy succeeds.
- Module top-level code must not touch the game. Persistent state goes in `storage.agent_harness`.
- Changing prototypes or `control.lua` still needs a game reload.
